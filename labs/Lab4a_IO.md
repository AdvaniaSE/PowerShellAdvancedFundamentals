Write a function that:

+ Takes one parameter (path to text file or uri to file on github) with some type of validation
+ Gets data from either
    1. Lab4.txt in your local repo (cloned)
    2. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PalmEmanuel/PSLabs/master/Lab4_Input.txt directly
+ Summarizes the input values and presents a result as an output from the function
