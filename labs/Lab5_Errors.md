1. Write a try/catch/finally block and try both terminating and non-terminating errors using a function such as Get-Item to see if PowerShell behaves

2. Write a loop in the try block and add a manual "throw" command after a certain number of iterations

3. Add a breakpoint and run the script to see the debug mode, then try it again with hitcount and expression
